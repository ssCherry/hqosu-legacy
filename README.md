Hello! I just extended support for hqOsu, unlike legacy which is not supported anymore (osu! executable is still 2019 version).

Mine is constantly updated, which can be found on my profile or you can go to https://github.com/Hazuki-san/hqOsu-xtreme instead.

If you got more questions or request, you can join Ainu xheaters discord.

Thank you for reading!
